          We use our research to transform lives across the four nations and
          globally.

          We take a challenge-led and open approach to research through our Open
          Societal Challenges (OSC).

          These Challenges are driving real change across the themes of
          Sustainability, Tackling Inequalities and Living Well.

          We need the brightest minds to address the most pressing needs of our
          time and we are building a more diverse next generation of research
          leaders to continue to support this and to broaden our horizons.
